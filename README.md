**Date:** December 27, 2025
**User Context:** Two brothers (NRIs in USA). Property in New Delhi (bought in 1973).
**Status:** One brother traveling to India; One brother staying in USA.
**Key Constraint:** Brother in USA does *not* currently have an NRO Bank Account.

---

## 🛑 Phase 1: Critical "Pre-Flight" Actions (USA)
*You must complete these before the traveling brother leaves the US.*

### 1. Brother's NRO Bank Account (URGENT BLOCKER)
* **The Issue:** The buyer cannot legally pay your brother his 50% share to a US bank account. He cannot write a check to him without an Indian account.
* **The Solution:** Your brother must open a **Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO)** account immediately.
* **Method:** Remote opening via **SBI, ICICI, HDFC, or DBS** (NRI Services).
    * *Process:* Fill online form → Print → Sign → Notarize in US → Courier to India branch.
    * *Time:* ~2–3 weeks. Start today.

### 2. Special Power of Attorney (SPA)
* **Purpose:** Your brother authorizes you to sign the deed and receive payments on his behalf.
* **Drafting Requirement:** The SPA must specifically authorize you to:
    1.  Apply for Mutation (Title Transfer) at MCD/DDA.
    2.  Sign the Agreement to Sell and receive "Earnest Money."
    3.  **Admit execution** of the Sale Deed before the Sub-Registrar.
    4.  Receive payments via Cheque/RTGS into *his* NRO account.
* **Execution Steps:**
    1.  **Notarize:** Brother signs before a US Notary Public.
    2.  **Attest:** Take the notarized document to the **Consulate General of India** (e.g., Chicago).

## ✈️ Phase 2: Arrival in Delhi (First 90 Days)

### 1. Adjudicate the POA (Priority #1)
* **The Rule:** A foreign POA is invalid in Indian courts until "Adjudicated."
* **Action:** Within **90 days** of arrival, take the original US-attested POA to the **Divisional Commissioner’s Office (Revenue Dept)** in your district (e.g., Sham Nath Marg).
* **Cost:** Stamp duty (approx. ₹100–₹500). They will stamp it "Adjudicated."

### 2. Mutation (Transferring Title)
* **The 2025 Update:** As of Dec 2025, **Probate** (court certification of a Will) is no longer mandatory for registered Wills, even in strict jurisdictions. You can apply directly with the Will.
* **Action:** Apply at the **Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD)** portal for "Mutation".
* **Documents Required:**
    * Registered Will.
    * Death Certificate of parent.
    * Affidavit & Indemnity Bond (confirming no other claimants).
    * Up-to-date Property Tax Receipts.

### 3. Valuation Report (Crucial for Tax)
* **The Context:** Property bought in 1973. Tax is calculated on **2001** value.
* **Action:** Hire a **Government Registered Valuer** in Delhi.
* **Output:** A certificate stating the **Fair Market Value (FMV) as of April 1, 2001**.
    * *Impact:* This 2001 value (e.g., ₹25 Lakhs) becomes your "Purchase Price" for tax calculations, replacing the 1973 price (₹15,000).

## 💰 Phase 3: Financials & Taxes (The "12.5%" Rule)

### 1. Capital Gains Tax (NRI Rules 2025)
* **New Rule (Finance Act 2024/25):** NRIs typically pay a flat **12.5%** Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax on property sold after July 23, 2024.
* **Indexation Note:** Unlike residents, NRIs usually **do not** get the benefit of "Indexation" (inflation adjustment) on the 2001 price.
* **The Formula:**
    * `Sale Price` (₹2 Cr) MINUS `FMV 2001` (₹25 Lakhs) = **Profit** (₹1.75 Cr).
    * **Tax:** 12.5% of Profit (+ Surcharge/Cess).

### 2. The "Lower TDS" Strategy (Form 13)
* **The Trap:** If you do nothing, the buyer is legally forced to deduct **~23% of the TOTAL Sale Price** (approx. ₹46 Lakhs) as TDS. You will lose access to this cash for years.
* **The Fix:** As soon as you find a buyer (before final payment), hire a CA to file **Form 13** on the Income Tax Portal.
* **Result:** You get a certificate authorizing the buyer to deduct only the actual tax liability (approx. 11–13%), keeping ~₹20+ Lakhs extra in your pocket immediately.

## ✍️ Phase 4: Execution of Sale

### 1. The Sale Deed "Consideration Clause"
* **Requirement:** The deed must clearly show the split payment to satisfy the buyer's TDS requirements.
* **Sample Text for Deed:**
    > *"The Total Sale Consideration of ₹2,00,00,000 (Rupees Two Crores) is being paid by the Vendee to the Vendors in the following manner:*
    > *1. ₹1,00,00,000 (Less TDS) to [Your Name] via Cheque No. XXX drawn on [Bank Name].*
    > *2. ₹1,00,00,000 (Less TDS) to [Brother's Name] via Cheque No. YYY drawn on [Bank Name]."*

### 2. Payment Day Logistics
* **Buyer's Duty:** The buyer hands over **two separate checks** (or makes two RTGS transfers).
* **Your Duty:** You accept your check. As POA holder, you accept your brother's check and deposit it into **his** NRO account.

### 3. Repatriation (Sending money to USA)
* **Limit:** Up to **$1 Million USD** per financial year per person.
* **Process:**
    1.  Money sits in NRO Account.
    2.  CA issues **Form 15CB**.
    3.  You file **Form 15CA** online.
    4.  Bank transfers funds to your US Bank (Bank of America/Chase, etc.).
