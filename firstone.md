## 🛑 Phase 1: Critical Actions in USA (Before Travel)
*Do not skip these. These are "blockers" that can stop the sale.*

### 1. Brother's NRO Bank Account (URGENT)
* **Problem:** The buyer legally cannot pay your brother his 50% share to a US bank account. He cannot receive a check without an Indian account.
* **Action:** Your brother must open a **Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO)** account immediately.
* **How:** Apply online with SBI, ICICI, HDFC, or DBS.
    * Fill form online → Print → Sign → Notarize in US → Courier to India branch.

### 2. Special Power of Attorney (SPA)
Your brother authorizes you to handle the mutation and sale.
* **Drafting:** The SPA must specifically authorize you to:
    * Apply for Mutation (Title Transfer) at MCD/DDA.
    * Sign the Agreement to Sell and receive "Earnest Money."
    * **Crucial:** Admit execution of the Sale Deed before the Sub-Registrar.
    * Receive payments on his behalf (into *his* NRO account).
* **Execution Steps:**
    1.  **Notarize:** Brother signs before a US Notary Public.
    2.  **Attest:** Take the notarized document to the **Consulate General of India, Chicago**. (Check their website for "Power of Attorney Attestation" requirements).

## ✈️ Phase 2: Arrival in Delhi (First 90 Days)
*You have a ticking clock once you land.*

### 1. Adjudicate the POA (Priority #1)
* **Rule:** A foreign POA is invalid in Delhi until "Adjudicated."
* **Action:** Within **90 days** of arrival, take the original US-attested POA to the **Divisional Commissioner’s Office (Revenue Dept)** in your district (e.g., Sham Nath Marg).
* **Cost:** Stamp duty (approx. ₹100–₹500). They will stamp it "Adjudicated."

### 2. Mutation (Transferring Title)
* **Why:** You cannot sell until the property tax bill has *your* names on it.
* **Action:** Apply at the **Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD)** portal.
* **Documents:**
    * Registered Will.
    * Death Certificate of parent.
    * Affidavit/Indemnity Bond from both brothers (confirming no other claimants).
    * Up-to-date Property Tax receipts.

### 3. Valuation Report (For Taxes)
* **Why:** Your purchase date is 1973, but tax is calculated on the value as of **2001**.
* **Action:** Hire a "Government Registered Valuer" (not a broker).
* **Result:** Get a certificate stating the **Fair Market Value (FMV) on April 1, 2001**.
    * *Example:* If 2001 Value = ₹25 Lakhs, this is your new "Purchase Price" for tax math.

## 💰 Phase 3: Financials & Taxes
*The sale price is approx. ₹2 Crores.*

### 1. Capital Gains Calculation (2025 Rules for NRIs)
* **Formula:** `Sale Price` - `FMV (2001)` = `Capital Gain (Profit)`
* **Example:**
    * Sale Price: ₹2,00,00,000
    * FMV (2001): ₹25,00,000
    * **Taxable Profit:** ₹1,75,00,000
* **Tax Rate:** Flat **12.5%** on the profit (plus cess/surcharge).
    * *Note: NRIs typically do not get "Indexation" (inflation adjustment) benefits.*

### 2. The "Lower TDS" Strategy (Save Cash Flow)
* **The Problem:** If you do nothing, the buyer MUST deduct **~20-23% of the Total Sale Price** (approx. ₹46 Lakhs) and give it to the Govt. You won't see this money for years.
* **The Solution:** File **Form 13** (Income Tax Portal) as soon as you find a buyer.
* **Result:** You get a certificate allowing the buyer to deduct only the actual tax (approx. 11-13%), keeping more cash in your hand immediately.

## ✍️ Phase 4: Execution of Sale
*Signing the deal.*

1.  **Agreement to Sell (ATS):** You take a ~10% token advance.
2.  **Payment Split:** The Sale Deed will list two sellers.
    * **Check 1:** ₹1 Crore (less TDS) → To Your NRO Account.
    * **Check 2:** ₹1 Crore (less TDS) → To Brother's NRO Account (Handed to you as POA).
3.  **Signing:** You sign the deed twice (Once as yourself, once as POA).
4.  **Repatriation (Sending money to USA):**
    * After the sale, hire a Chartered Accountant (CA).
    * Get **Forms 15CA & 15CB**.
    * Submit to bank to transfer funds from NRO account to US Bank (Limit: $1 Million USD per financial year).
